# Ledger Book
Simple Database to store Ledger Records and get reports of Money Stash. All values are in common currency unit (EuroDollar).

**The Database does not involve storing multiple Accounts and is not a personal finance Tracker (purchasing Goods, paying Bills, etc.)**

**The main Goal is tracking the savings Account**

- DB: SQLite or PostgreSQL
- PostgREST (if need HTTP Interface for PostgreSQL)
- Grafana

# Database Structure
## Create Table Structure

- id - auto inc Value
- date - ISO 8601 Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- amount - only Integer (Why count Ð¡ents?)

### SQLite
```sql
CREATE TABLE "ledger" (
  "id" INTEGER,
  "date" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "amount" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY("id" AUTOINCREMENT)
)
```

### PostgreSQL
```sql
CREATE TABLE "ledger" (
  "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  "date" DATE NOT NULL,
  "amount" INT NOT NULL
)
```


# Data Manipulation 
## Insert Ledger Record
```sql
INSERT INTO ledger ("date", amount)
VALUES ('2022-06-25', -18)
```

## Delete Ledger Record
```sql
DELETE FROM ledger
WHERE id = 52
```

## Update Ledger Record
```sql
UPDATE ledger
SET "date" = '2022-06-25', "amount" = '1000'
WHERE id = 23
```

# Overview

*The main Approach is quick get main Measurements and using in big Numbers in Grafana*

![Ledger Overview](https://github.com/SA-Inc/Ledger-Book/blob/main/img/Ledger%20Overview.png)

## Current Balance
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(amount) AS "balance"
FROM ledger
```

## Total Income
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN amount > 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "income"
FROM ledger
```

## Total Outcome
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN amount < 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "outcome"
FROM ledger
```

## Total Transactions
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(date) AS "total_transactions"
FROM ledger
```

## Total Income Transactions
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN amount > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "total_income_transactions"
FROM ledger
```

## Total Outcome Transactions
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN amount < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "total_outcome_transactions"
FROM ledger
```

## Unique Transaction Dates
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT date) AS "unique_transaction_dates"
FROM ledger
```

## First Transaction Date
```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(
    EXTRACT(
      YEAR FROM date), '-',
      LPAD(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)::text, 2, '0'), '-',
      LPAD(EXTRACT(DAY FROM date)::text, 2, '0')
  ) AS "first_transaction_date"
FROM ledger
ORDER BY "date" ASC
LIMIT 1
```

## Last Transaction Date
```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(
    EXTRACT(
      YEAR FROM date), '-',
      LPAD(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)::text, 2, '0'), '-',
      LPAD(EXTRACT(DAY FROM date)::text, 2, '0')
  ) AS "last_transaction_date"
FROM ledger
ORDER BY "date" DESC
LIMIT 1
```

# Pivot Tables
## Running Balance

Shows Running Balance (Running Total/Cumulative Sum/Prefix Sum) and Delta in Percents between current and previous Running Balances

![Running Balance](https://github.com/SA-Inc/Ledger-Book/blob/main/img/Running%20Balance.png)

*Field difference is commented because is actualy amount*

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date), '-', LPAD(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)::text, 2, '0'), '-', LPAD(EXTRACT(DAY FROM date)::text, 2, '0')) AS "date",
  "amount",
  "balance",
-- COALESCE(("balance" - "previous_balance"), 0) AS "difference",
  CASE WHEN "previous_balance" = 0
    THEN 0
    ELSE ROUND(COALESCE(100.0 * ("balance" - "previous_balance") / "previous_balance", 0), 2)
    END AS "delta"
FROM (
  SELECT "id", "date", "amount", "balance",
  LAG("balance", 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY "id") AS "previous_balance"
  FROM (
    SELECT "id", "date", "amount",
      SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY "id") AS "balance"
    FROM ledger
    ORDER BY id ASC
  ) s
)f
```

## Year Income Outcome

![Running Balance](https://github.com/SA-Inc/Ledger-Book/blob/main/img/Year%20Income%20Outcome.png)

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS "year",
  COUNT("id") AS "transactions",
  SUM(CASE WHEN amount < 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "outcome",
  SUM(CASE WHEN amount > 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "income",
  SUM(amount) AS "sum"
FROM ledger
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)
ORDER BY "year" ASC
```

## Year Month Income Outcome

![Running Balance](https://github.com/SA-Inc/Ledger-Book/blob/main/img/Year%20Month%20Income%20Outcome.png)

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date), '-', LPAD(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)::text, 2, '0')) AS "date",
  COUNT("id") AS "transactions",
  SUM(CASE WHEN amount < 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "outcome",
  SUM(CASE WHEN amount > 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "income",
  SUM(amount) AS "sum"
FROM ledger
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)
ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)
```
